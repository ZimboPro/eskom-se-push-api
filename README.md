# EskomSePush API

This Rust library is an unofficial libray to the EskomSePush API

## TODO

- [ ] Improve error types
- [ ] Add examples
- [ ] Allow for getting API key from environment variables
- [ ] Features to control sync and async functionality
- [x] Improve status struct to allow for more flexible structure for future proofing (Towns/cities with different loadshedding schedule might be added in the future)
